                <h3>Welcome to camfinancials solutions!</h3>
                <p>Our goal and mission is to help families keep more of their hard-earned dollars, as well as increasing their cash-flow. We believe that it's not what you make, but rather, what you keep! The adage of paying yourself first still rings true today. We educate our clients about impacting tax changes, as well as a variety of deductions and how they affect their tax liabilities.</p>

                <p>Camfinancials has been helping families improve their financial lives since 2004 and was created to help people achieve and exceed their financial goals. We subscribe to the old adage that "a penny saved is a penny earned".</p>

                <p>The tax laws are written for all tax payers, therefore, all of us are entitled to various tax incentives made possible by the United States Congress. As we all know, education is the key that unlocks many doors.</p>

                <p>We don't just prepare taxes for our clients, we provide them with the necessary education needed as it relates to tax planning and liabilities. Most people don't plan to fail, they simply fail to plan. This lack of planning often leads to a bigger tax bill.</p>

                <p>The average person pays more than 35 percent of their income in taxes; some pay as much as 45 percentage! We empower our clients with the knowledge vital to ensure that they pay their fair share of taxes and no more. Our one-on-one interview with our clients generally reveals deductions they did not realize were available to them.<br>
